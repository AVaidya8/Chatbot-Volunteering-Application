# Chatbot-Volunteering-Application
 A chatbot application that will be able to help user’s find local non-profit organizations or general places where they can volunteer or donate items. The user can input information such as their location (filter based on whether the non-profit is within a 5 mile, 10 mile, etc. radius), the type of items accepted, the type of activity, etc. If volunteering at an event, the chatbot will text the users a few days before the event to remind them. We will use an API, such as Charity Navigator’s API or the GlobalGiving API to get the data needed for the project. We will put this chatbot within a website where students can track their volunteer service hours and record their goals.
